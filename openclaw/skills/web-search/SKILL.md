# Web Search

Search the web via the `websearch` CLI. Uses DuckDuckGo (ddgr) as primary provider and Tavily API as fallback with AI-powered answers.

## Quick Search

```bash
websearch "best restaurants in Boston"
websearch "weather tomorrow Boston"
websearch "python requests library docs"
```

Default behavior: tries ddgr first (free, unlimited), falls back to Tavily if ddgr fails.

## Search with Tavily AI Answer

```bash
websearch tavily "what is the capital of France"
websearch tavily "how does photosynthesis work"
```

The `tavily` subcommand uses the Tavily API and includes an AI-generated answer along with source results.

## Options

```bash
# Limit number of results
websearch -n 10 "search query"

# Restrict to a specific site (ddgr only)
websearch -s reddit.com "best headphones"

# Force a specific provider
websearch -p tavily "search query"
websearch -p ddgr "search query"

# Tavily topic filter
websearch tavily -t news "tech layoffs"

# Include AI answer with default search
websearch --answer -p tavily "search query"

# JSON output
websearch --json "search query"
```

## Check Provider Status

```bash
websearch status
```

Shows whether ddgr and Tavily are available and configured.

## Global Flags

- `--json` — Machine-readable JSON output
- `-n, --num N` — Number of results (default: 5, max: 20)
- `-s, --site DOMAIN` — Restrict to domain (ddgr only)
- `-p, --provider NAME` — Force provider: `ddgr` or `tavily`

## Providers

| Provider | Cost | API Key | Best For |
|----------|------|---------|----------|
| **ddgr** (default) | Free | None | General searches, quick lookups |
| **Tavily** (fallback) | 1,000/month free | Required | AI-optimized results, answers |

## Notes

- ddgr is always tried first (free, no rate limits)
- Tavily is used as fallback or when explicitly requested
- Tavily API key is stored in 1Password: `op://OpenClaw/Tavily/api_key`
- Cached at `~/.cache/openclaw-gateway/tavily_api_key`
- Logs are written to `~/.openclaw/logs/websearch.log`
