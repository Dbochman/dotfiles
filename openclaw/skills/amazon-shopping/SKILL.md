# Amazon Shopping

Search, browse, and purchase products on Amazon using browser automation and saved Amazon checkout details. The OpenClaw gateway and its children must never invoke `op`; missing payment data requires an attended handoff.

## Important: Purchase Approval Required

**NEVER place an order without explicit approval from Dylan.**

Before clicking "Place your order":
1. Summarize: item name, price, shipping speed, delivery estimate
2. Wait for Dylan's explicit "yes" / "go ahead" / approval
3. If no response, do NOT proceed

## Spending Limits

- **Hard cap**: Never exceed the credit limit (currently $250)
- **Soft cap**: Flag anything over $100 for extra confirmation
- When displaying prices, always include tax estimate if visible

## Shopping Flow

### 1. Search for Products

```
browser open "https://www.amazon.com"
browser snapshot
browser type <search_box_ref> "search query"
browser press Enter
browser snapshot
```

### 2. Browse Results

```
browser snapshot
# Click on a product to view details
browser click <product_ref>
browser snapshot
```

When presenting results to Dylan, include:
- Product name
- Price (and per-unit price if applicable)
- Star rating and review count
- Prime eligibility
- Delivery estimate

### 3. Add to Cart

```
browser click <add_to_cart_ref>
browser snapshot
```

### 4. Proceed to Checkout

```
browser open "https://www.amazon.com/gp/cart/view.cgi"
browser snapshot
browser click <proceed_to_checkout_ref>
browser snapshot
```

### 5. Fill Payment Details (if needed)

Amazon should have a saved payment method. If checkout requests card fields,
stop and ask Dylan to complete payment entry in an attended session. Never call
`op`, place card data in the general secrets cache, or expose payment fields in
chat or tool output.

### 6. Fill Shipping Address (if needed)

Read the local-only address file for field values:
```bash
cat ~/.openclaw/skills/amazon-shopping/address.local.md
```

If the file does not exist or is incomplete, stop and ask Dylan for an attended
checkout update. Do not fall back to `op` from the gateway process.

### 7. Review Order (MANDATORY)

Before placing the order, **always**:

```
browser snapshot
```

Report to Dylan:
- Item(s) and quantities
- Item price(s)
- Shipping method and cost
- Tax
- **Order total**
- Estimated delivery date

**Then ask: "Should I place this order for $X.XX?"**

### 8. Place Order (ONLY after approval)

```
browser click <place_order_ref>
browser snapshot
```

Confirm the order was placed and report:
- Order confirmation number
- Expected delivery date

```

### Check Today's Deals

## Tips

- **Prime**: Dylan has Amazon Prime. Always filter results to Prime-eligible items with free shipping. Do not suggest non-Prime items unless specifically asked or no Prime option exists.
- **Compare**: When asked to "find" something, show 2-3 options at different price points
- **Reviews**: Mention review count and rating — avoid items below 4 stars unless specifically requested
- **Subscribe & Save**: Mention if available for recurring purchases, but don't auto-enroll
- **Used/Renewed**: Only suggest if Dylan asks for cheaper options
- **Gift cards**: Never purchase gift cards without explicit request

## Safety Rules

- NEVER place an order without Dylan's explicit approval
- NEVER exceed the credit limit
- NEVER purchase gift cards, subscriptions, or recurring items without explicit request
- NEVER change account settings (address book, payment methods, Prime membership)
- NEVER share card details in messages — mask as `****0298`
- If CAPTCHA or 2FA appears, notify Dylan
- If the session expires (login required), notify Dylan — see Re-Auth Procedure below

## Re-Auth Procedure

OpenClaw uses **system Google Chrome** (not Playwright Chromium) with a separate profile at `~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/`. You MUST re-auth using system Chrome — Playwright Chromium cookies are incompatible.

1. **Stop the OpenClaw gateway** (it holds the browser profile lock):
   ```bash
   launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway
   sleep 2
   pkill -f "Google Chrome"
   rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonLock
   rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonCookie
   rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonSocket
   ```

2. **Launch system Chrome** with the OpenClaw profile (must run in GUI session via `.command` file):
   ```bash
   # /tmp/amazon_chrome_login.command
   #!/bin/bash
   "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
     --user-data-dir=/Users/dbochman/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data \
     --no-first-run --no-default-browser-check \
     --password-store=basic \
     "https://www.amazon.com"
   ```
   Launch via: `open /tmp/amazon_chrome_login.command`

3. **Dylan signs in** on the Mac Mini screen (email, password, 2FA). **Do NOT sign into Google** — only sign into Amazon.

4. **Close browser and restart gateway**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "Google Chrome"
   rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonLock
   rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonCookie
   rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonSocket
   launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
   ```

## Troubleshooting: Browser CDP Failure

If the browser fails with **"Failed to start Chrome CDP on port 18800"**:

### Cause 1: Stale SingletonLock files
After a gateway crash or unclean Chrome shutdown, lock files prevent new Chrome from starting.
```bash
rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonLock
rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonCookie
rm -f ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/SingletonSocket
pkill -f "Google Chrome.*--remote-debugging-port=18800"
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway
```

### Cause 2: Corrupted profile with encrypted tokens
OpenClaw uses **system Google Chrome** (not Playwright Chromium) with `--headless=new`. When a visible browser session signs into a Google account, Chrome stores encrypted tokens that require macOS Keychain access. The gateway runs headless and can't access the Keychain, causing Chrome to crash with `Trace/BPT trap` (SIGTRAP) immediately after starting.

**Diagnosis**: Chrome starts CDP (`DevTools listening on ws://...`) but dies within 1-2 seconds. Stderr shows `errKCInteractionNotAllowed` and `Failed to decrypt token for service AccountId-*`.

**Fix**: Replace the corrupted profile with a fresh one:
```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway
pkill -f "Google Chrome"
mv ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data.broken
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
```

**Note**: This loses all browser cookies (Amazon login, etc). You'll need to re-auth via the Re-Auth Procedure above. When re-authing, **do NOT sign into Google** in the visible Chromium — only sign into the target site (Amazon).

### Cause 3: Orphaned Chrome process on port 18800
```bash
lsof -i :18800
# If a Chrome process is found, kill it
kill <PID>
```

## Notes

- OpenClaw uses **system Google Chrome** (at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`) in headless mode — NOT Playwright Chromium
- Browser profile: `~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data/`
- Playwright Chromium at `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1208/` is only used for the visible re-auth procedure
- Must stop gateway before launching visible browser (SingletonLock conflict)
- Use `browser snapshot` frequently to stay oriented on the page
- Amazon's DOM changes frequently — always snapshot before interacting
- If a page looks wrong or unexpected, take a `browser screenshot` for visual confirmation
